Version 0.6-9, 18 Dec 2009
Created comfort for analysing designs with several response variables:
- added response selection to the currently available analysis menus
- removed design selection from linear model menu; this menu now always refers 
  to the design in the active dataset, like the other analysis menus

Version 0.6-8, 10 Dec 2009
- added menu for permanently removing columns from the design
- added menu for modifying factor contrasts
- bug fix: help button for response selection menu now points to the correct 
  help file

Version 0.6-7, 21 Nov 2009
- improved help for manually incorporating blocks into designs with 
  estimable 2-factor interactions 
- bug fix: directory selection did not work on export tabs of design creation
  menus

Version 0.6-6, 25 Oct 2009
- added help button to "Estimable Model" tab for regular 2-level fractional factorials

Version 0.6-5, 25 Oct 2009
- a few changes to help files
- made several menus more comfortable:
  - keep decimal settings between menus and calls in menus (except for export sub 
    menus of larger menus)
  - allow change of working directory in import, export and add response menu
  - keep further settings in export, import and add response menus, 
    especially in case of errors, so that corrections can be made more comfortably
- small layout changes to Estimable Model tab 
  for regular 2-level fractional factorials
- bug fix: maximum time for searching for designs with specified 2fis not aliased  
  with each other or with main effects (Estimable Model tab 
  for regular 2-level fractional factorials)
  was not properly implemented (search was always 60 seconds);
  - improvement for this situation: indication that search is in progress in the output window

Version 0.6, 18 Oct 2009
- changed strategy for error messages when generating designs (affects all design 
  generating and design modifying menus):
  After pressing OK with options that lead to an error, instead of closing the 
  menu and printing a warning in the messages log, the menu is re-opened with an 
  error message in the messages log. Also, the offending command is not printed into the 
  script and output window, but into the messages log only.
- bug fix: wrong creator class for ccd designs (menu.designlhs instead of menu.designccd)
- bug fix: in case of an error message that re-opens the dialog, messages are suppressed
- bug fix: for Menu.wide, re-opening the menu did not work
- bug fix: disabled "Quantitative" separator line from Create Design menu
- bug fix: disabled transformation element on aggregate.design menu, 
  which does not work yet
- bug fix: changed default formula for models with center points to not add a dummy 
  for the center points (dummy was not found); 
  eventually, there will be an option for including a dummy
  ...

Version 0.5-6, 17 Oct 2009
- made changes to common factor levels for 2-level designs work immediately, not with delay
- made radio buttons on "Estimable Model" tab for regular 2-level designs bring up the 
  appropriate controls without delay

Version 0.5-5, 08 Oct 2009
- corrected various copy-paste errors in titles and descriptions of help files
- made all Info menu items always visible

Version 0.5-4, 08 Oct 2009
- introduced dependence on Rcmdr version at least 1.4-6 
  (because of issues with building menus and displaying messages in earlier versions)
- added a help topic for choosing between screening and regular fractional factorial designs
- updated displayed available designs to reflect current status of designs implemented in 
  package FrF2
- improved calls to plotting routines in 2-level effect plots menus 
  under Analyse Design (enabled by methods for designs in package FrF2):
  calls were awkward before for main effects and interaction plots, and 
  call documentation was incomplete for (half) normal effects plots

Version 0.5-3, 28 Sep 2009
- corrected default setting for colnospecifyVariable in menu for 
  general factorial designs
- corrected behavior of the oa.design menu when switching back 
  from a named design with columns specified to automatic selection

Version 0.5-2, 25 Sep 2009
- corrected further links in documentation

Version 0.5-1, 24 Sep 2009
- corrected a few links in documentation 
- added Encoding field to DESCRIPTION
- added version requirements to packages DoE.base, FrF2 and DoE.wrapper 
  in DESCRIPTION

Version 0.5: Beta version released 24 Sep 2009
