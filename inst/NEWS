Version 0.6, 18 Oct 2009
- changed strategy for error messages when generating designs (affects all design 
  generating and design modifying menus):
  After pressing OK with options that lead to an error, instead of closing the 
  menu and printing a warning in the messages log, the menu is re-opened with an 
  error message in the messages log. Also, the offending command is not printed into the 
  script and output window, but into the messages log only.
- bug fix: wrong creator class for ccd designs (menu.designlhs instead of menu.designccd)
- bug fix: in case of an error message that re-opens the dialog, messages are suppressed
- bug fix: for Menu.wide, re-opening the menu did not work
- bug fix: disabled "Quantitative" separator line from Create Design menu
- bug fix: disabled transformation element on aggregate.design menu, 
  which does not work yet
- bug fix: changed default formula for models with center points to not add a dummy 
  for the center points (dummy was not found); 
  eventually, there will be an option for including a dummy
  ...

Version 0.5-6, 17 Oct 2009
- made changes to common factor levels for 2-level designs work immediately, not with delay
- made radio buttons on "Estimable Model" tab for regular 2-level designs bring up the 
  appropriate controls without delay

Version 0.5-5, 08 Oct 2009
- corrected various copy-paste errors in titles and descriptions of help files
- made all Info menu items always visible

Version 0.5-4, 08 Oct 2009
- introduced dependence on Rcmdr version at least 1.4-6 
  (because of issues with building menus and displaying messages in earlier versions)
- added a help topic for choosing between screening and regular fractional factorial designs
- updated displayed available designs to reflect current status of designs implemented in 
  package FrF2
- improved calls to plotting routines in 2-level effect plots menus 
  under Analyse Design (enabled by methods for designs in package FrF2):
  calls were awkward before for main effects and interaction plots, and 
  call documentation was incomplete for (half) normal effects plots

Version 0.5-3, 28 Sep 2009
- corrected default setting for colnospecifyVariable in menu for 
  general factorial designs
- corrected behavior of the oa.design menu when switching back 
  from a named design with columns specified to automatic selection
