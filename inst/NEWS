Version history: 

23 Jan 2011, Version 0.9-1
   - deactivated D-optimal design creation menu for missing candidate designs
   - made D-optimal candidate design selection more comfortables, 
     allowing also selection of an existing design from within the candidate 
     creation menu.
   - fixed bug which made help for D-optimal designs in the design creation menu 
     inaccessible
   - updated a link to Rcmdr installation instructions

30 Oct 2010, Version 0.9
   - adapted information on available designs in menu for fractional factorial 
     2-level designs to extensions in package FrF2 

10 Aug 2010, Version 0.8
   - added analysis functionality for response surface designs
     - response surface model with FO, TWI, PQ, and SO notation
     - steepest ascent / descent analysis
     - contour and persp plots that also work for linear models in general
   - implemented simple version of D-optimal designs (no blocking so far)
   - improved menu for creation of ccd designs 
     (better defaults for cube portion, better guidance through menus)
   - modified NEWS file for better display with function news()
   Bug fixes
   - resetting ccd menu would use wrong defaults (from lhs instead of ccd)
   - star portion of ccd augmentation ignored the specified number of center points 
     star portion (and always used the default 4); only the center points 
     specified with the cube portion, if any, were honored
   - list of 2-level designs did not include 2-level full factorials
   - current model information was not stored for linear models based on design
   - a harmless warning was not suppressed in menuLinearModelDesign

04 Jun 2010, Version 0.6-14
   Bug fixes:
   - contrary to documentation, the default linear model tab worked for models with 2-level factors only.

23 Apr 2010, Version 0.6-13
   - improved Base Settings tab for regular fractional factorials 
     to allow specification of an extra catalogue without having to specify the design itself
       - fourth radio button for catlg only
       - design radio button always also displays catalogue entry box, which is now a combobox
   - allowed loading of special further design catalogues 
     for regular fractional factorials from package FrF2.catlg128, 
     if installed
   - added possibility to display design.info attribute
bug fixes: 
   - fixed command for selection of specific catalogue 
     (for generating regular fractional factorials) and 
     added dependence on new version of FrF2, because catalogue selection did not 
     work properly in earlier versions
   - corrected an instruction in Menu.import.Rd (regarding loading of R workspace)

03 Apr 2010, Version 0.6-12
bug fix: added requirement for DoE.base version 0.10 
(new design inspection for creation of general orthogonal arrays did not work for older versions)

26 Mar 2010, Version 0.6-11
- updated resolution information to include newly implemented designs 
  from packages FrF2 and DoE.base 
  (and included bug fix to previous version that was incomplete regarding 64 run designs)
- updated general orthogonal arrays: 
    - added automatic optimization
    - added button for displaying available designs
- updated "Inspect design" menu: 
    - all menu items work for active design only
    - summary only does the printed summary itself
    - plot and table become menu items themselves, 
      with the added possibility of selecting a subset of factors only
- bug fix: creation of general orthogonal arrays did not work for most recent version 
  of package DoE.base

03 Jan 2010, Version 0.6-10
- added possibility for compromise designs to estimable menu for regular fractional factorials
- Bugfix: error message for wrong response specigication in add response menu

18 Dec 2009, Version 0.6-9
Created comfort for analysing designs with several response variables:
- added response selection to the currently available analysis menus
- removed design selection from linear model menu; this menu now always refers 
  to the design in the active dataset, like the other analysis menus

10 Dec 2009, Version 0.6-8
- added menu for permanently removing columns from the design
- added menu for modifying factor contrasts
- bug fix: help button for response selection menu now points to the correct 
  help file

21 Nov 2009, Version 0.6-7
- improved help for manually incorporating blocks into designs with 
  estimable 2-factor interactions 
- bug fix: directory selection did not work on export tabs of design creation
  menus

25 Oct 2009, Version 0.6-6
- added help button to "Estimable Model" tab for regular 2-level fractional factorials

25 Oct 2009, Version 0.6-5
- a few changes to help files
- made several menus more comfortable:
  - keep decimal settings between menus and calls in menus (except for export sub 
    menus of larger menus)
  - allow change of working directory in import, export and add response menu
  - keep further settings in export, import and add response menus, 
    especially in case of errors, so that corrections can be made more comfortably
- small layout changes to Estimable Model tab 
  for regular 2-level fractional factorials
- bug fix: maximum time for searching for designs with specified 2fis not aliased  
  with each other or with main effects (Estimable Model tab 
  for regular 2-level fractional factorials)
  was not properly implemented (search was always 60 seconds);
  - improvement for this situation: indication that search is in progress in the output window

18 Oct 2009, Version 0.6
- changed strategy for error messages when generating designs (affects all design 
  generating and design modifying menus):
  After pressing OK with options that lead to an error, instead of closing the 
  menu and printing a warning in the messages log, the menu is re-opened with an 
  error message in the messages log. Also, the offending command is not printed into the 
  script and output window, but into the messages log only.
- bug fix: wrong creator class for ccd designs (menu.designlhs instead of menu.designccd)
- bug fix: in case of an error message that re-opens the dialog, messages are suppressed
- bug fix: for Menu.wide, re-opening the menu did not work
- bug fix: disabled "Quantitative" separator line from Create Design menu
- bug fix: disabled transformation element on aggregate.design menu, 
  which does not work yet
- bug fix: changed default formula for models with center points to not add a dummy 
  for the center points (dummy was not found); 
  eventually, there will be an option for including a dummy
  ...

17 Oct 2009, Version 0.5-6
- made changes to common factor levels for 2-level designs work immediately, not with delay
- made radio buttons on "Estimable Model" tab for regular 2-level designs bring up the 
  appropriate controls without delay

08 Oct 2009, Version 0.5-5
- corrected various copy-paste errors in titles and descriptions of help files
- made all Info menu items always visible

08 Oct 2009, Version 0.5-4
- introduced dependence on Rcmdr version at least 1.4-6 
  (because of issues with building menus and displaying messages in earlier versions)
- added a help topic for choosing between screening and regular fractional factorial designs
- updated displayed available designs to reflect current status of designs implemented in 
  package FrF2
- improved calls to plotting routines in 2-level effect plots menus 
  under Analyse Design (enabled by methods for designs in package FrF2):
  calls were awkward before for main effects and interaction plots, and 
  call documentation was incomplete for (half) normal effects plots

28 Sep 2009, Version 0.5-3
- corrected default setting for colnospecifyVariable in menu for 
  general factorial designs
- corrected behavior of the oa.design menu when switching back 
  from a named design with columns specified to automatic selection

- corrected a few links in documentation 
- added Encoding field to DESCRIPTION
- added version requirements to packages DoE.base, FrF2 and DoE.wrapper 
  in DESCRIPTION
